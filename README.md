# The Tale of Tim, Tym, and Timm
Our game is a rogue-like dungeon crawler with heavy inspiration from Realm of the Mad God.

In our game, the player is able to select from three unique classes, The Wizard, The Knight, and The Rogue.


When you first begin your journey, you will be located within our hearty hub, a warm log cabin located in a grassy plain.

From here, you are able to change classes and access our various dungeons, each with their own unique look, monsters and boss.


In order to reduce repetitiveness and have each dungeon run be unique, we opted for a procedural generation system to create our dungeons.

Enemies/Monsters and decorations are randomly spawned within rooms that are connected by corridors. Pass through all of them and fight an epic battle with the dungeon
boss.

Be careful though, death will spell the end of your entire journey, no respawns.


The boss and the enemies within will drop loot, with the strength of the items dropped varying depending on what difficulty dungeon you're exploring.

When the boss is killed, the player may trace his steps and return to the hub portal where they can rest and recuperate until the next dungeon.


All three of our classes have their own unique designs and gameplay mechanics apart from sharing a dash ability.

The wizard has the ability to overload their mana circuits, allowing them to shoot fireballs in rapid succession.

The rogue has the ability to go invisible and increase their movement speed for a short time.

The Knight has the ability to become invincible and increase their damage for a short time.


All of our assets apart from the ones listed below were created by our designers and programmers:
